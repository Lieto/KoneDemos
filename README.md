KoneDemos
=========

Demonstrations to use Kone, 3d physics engine

Repository contains demonstrations of Kone.

Each demo includes Kone-source codes, so you don't need to download
engine separately.

However, demos use external jar-libraries for drawing on display. These
are:
slick-util.jar from: SlickUtil
gluegen-rt.jar from: JogAmp 
jogl-all.jar   from: JogAmp

You should find them googling magic word, but I will copy links to this README later.
